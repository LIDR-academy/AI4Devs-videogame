1) as a senior videogame software engineer, i want to create a minigolf game using kotlin and html and ahwtever you consider can be best for the project. I want to begin with something simple and nice
2) i have compilation errors, please check on the terminal and fix them
3) after several attempts, sonet wanted to create the game using JS, so I had to command it "no, i want all the logic to be implemented in kotlin"
4) more failures, at he end it builds the game with JS, so i had to insist until it kinf of worked, but not really, so I had to insist again "I can't play as you say, ple update readme with the usage instructions and check if everything is right"
5) more errors -> 30 minutes until it worked
6) clean everything up, all the files and tasks you created so I can only run the game with the runGame task
7) after several hours, it worked steadily
8) and now in our game, i want to see a complete golf stick whenever i am choosing power and direction moving and improve the general graphics a little bit
