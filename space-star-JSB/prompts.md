# Space Star: Last Chance

## Proceso de creaci√≥n

- Crear un prompt incicial muy detallado de todas las caracter√≠sticas y detalles del juego.
- Usar meta-prompting para mejorar la calidad del prompt.
- Llevar el prompt a Cursor en modo Agent con selecci√≥n de modelo Auto con un resultado bastante aceptable.
- Iterar con Cursor hasta conseguir el gameplay deseado.
- Generar la m√∫sica con [Suno](https://suno.com/) y a√±adi√©ndola a los assets hace que funcione autom√°ticamenten porque Cursor ya se hab√≠a encargado.
- Los sonidos de efectos los he descargado de [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) y los he a√±adido a los assets. Tambi√©n se han aplicado autom√°ticamente.
- Los fondos tanto para la pantalla de menu como el juego y las texturas del tunel las he creado con el nuevo generador de im√°genes de ChatGPT.
- He creado unas im√°genes de las naves con el generador de im√°genes de ChatGPT y luego he creado los modelos texturizados con [Meshy](https://www.meshy.ai/).
- Los modelos si que he tenido que pedirle a Cursor que los incluyera sustituyendo los modelos poligonales que hab√≠a anteriormente.

## Problemas enfrentados

La mayor√≠a de los problemas enfrentados han sido referentes a bugs. La mayor√≠a he podido solucionarlos con la ayuda de Cursor. Sin embargo, algunos problemas no pudieron ser resueltos a pesar de intentar darle m√°s contexto o incluso apoyarme en im√°genes.

- Los controles se vuelven mas inestables cuando se vuelve a empezar una partida.
- El t√∫nel a veces tiene unos "gaps" cerca de la c√°mara.
- El sonido del men√∫ no se reproduce al iniciar. Esto se debe a que los navegadores dehabilitan el sonido hasta que hay una interacci√≥n para mejorar la experiencia de usuario.

Tambi√©n encontr√© algunos problemas en la generaci√≥n de im√°genes de ChatGPT por alta demanda y tuve que esperar o cambiar la forma de realizar los prompts.

A pesar de toda la ayuda de la IA, tener el juego perfecto todav√≠a requiere tiempo y refinado.

### Mi prompt inicial

Can you help me to improve this game creation prompt so I have not missed something and performs well for software development?

# Prompt for a space combat videogame 

I want you to develop a *space combat* game using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, with the **Three JS** library, it must have an **index.html** file containing the main.js file as stated in [Three JS docs](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/installation) and importing the library from CDN. The latest version is 0.174.0  

## **Game Requirements:**
1. **Main Screen:**
   - The game title is "Space Star last chance"
   - There are 4 buttons so that the player can chose between:
      - **Start**: Starts the game.
      - **Controls**: Shows the controls screen.
      - **Ranking**: To see the current ranking.
   - On the top right corner, there is a button to **disable music but not fx**.
   - There is a **music playing** when you are in the menu unless player disables it.

2. **Game Screen:**  
   - There is a 3D **endless tunnel or corridor** having a "U" shape but with 90 degrees angles to conform the shape. It's a **one vanishing point** perspective.  
   - The floor and walls look like metal/carbon as in a **space station**. In fact, the player is hovering the tunnel of an space station.
   - The **background ceiling** is the **open space** having stars and a planet in the distance.
   - The player spaceship is view from **third-person view** perspective from behind.
   - The player spaceship can be controlled with the **keyboard arrows** to move the spaceship up, down, left and right.
   - The player spaceship can blast red lasers with the **space bar**.
   - On the top, a **shields** bar is shown with a percentage range **from 0 to 100 on the right of the bar**. Above the bar the word shields is shown. The bar and the percentage have a space indicator looking.
   - On the top right corner there are 2 indicators:
     - **Distance**: The distance that the player space ship has traveled starting from 0. 
     - **Speed**: Displays current speed starting from 10, being just a reference value not a real speed.
   - With the **initial speed 10**, the player spaceship travels **100m each second**.
   - Player spacehip can fire up to 3 blasts per second.
   - There are enemy spaceships coming from the background, so they **start being small** but **they get bigger as they approach** to the player spaceshift.
   - At the beginning, an enemy spaceship is spawn every 1000m.
   - Enemy spaceships blast green lasers.
   - The **player spaceship has a visual aim in front of it** so the player can calculate where the blasts are going to go.
   - The **visual aim moves and point where the front of the player spaceship looks at**.
   - The **visual aim engages an enemy** if it is very close to it.
   - The **visual aim disengages an enemy** if the player moves and the front of the spacehipo does not point or aim to that enemy.
   - A red blast from player spaceship destroys an enemy spaceship if the blast collides with the enemy, with an explosion.
   - Player space ship **can collide with the tunnel**.
   - Player space ship **can collide with enemy spaceships**.
   - Each **enemy blast decreases by 5** the player shields.
   - Each **collision decreases by 10** the player shields.
   - Each time the player spaceship collides or receives an enemy blast, **a light semi transparent red effect on the screen** will be shown.
   - If an **enemy spaceship reaches the player spaceship and goes beyond its plane**, it dissapears from the game.
   - Each **3000m the speed increases by 10**.
   - Each **3000m the enemy spawns every previousDistance-100m**.
   - The game **ends when player shields reach 0**.
   - When the game ends a popup is shown to player displaying:
     - **Distance**: The distance when the game ended.
     - **Speed**: The speed when the game ended.
     - **Enemies killed**: The number of enemies that the player killed.
     - An input to write their name.
     - An OK button that will save the **player name** and the **distance** in **localStorage**.
   - There is a **music playing** during the game unless player disabled it on the main menu. This song is different from the menu one.
   - Player can **return to main menu with the "esc" key**. He will be asked with a popup "Are you sure you want to quit? All the progress will be lost." having two buttons:
     - **Cancel**: to return to the game.
     - **Yes**: to go back to main menu screen.
   - **Sound effects**:  
     - A sound when a spacehip blasts.  
     - A sound for explosions of enemy spacehip.
     - A light sound when the player spaceship collides.
     - A sound when the game ends.    

3. **Ranking Screen:**  
   - Displays **the leaderboard**:
     - Ordered list showing *Player name* and *Distance*.  
     - Order is set by distance, **the higher the better**.
     - Shows the 10 best players.
   - Ranking data should be **stored in localStorage** and persist after closing the game.  

## **Interaction and Usability:**  
 
- **Smooth animations** when tiles move.  
- **Space aesthetic** All the screens and popup must have a **space wars** atmosphere and being consistent.

## **Delivery Format:**  
- Code should be structured in separate files:  
  - index.html (base structure).  
  - main.js (game logic using [ThreeJS imported using CDN](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/installation). The last version is 0.174.0).  
  - styles.css (design and retro styling).
  - assets/ (folder for images and sound effect).  
  - Code should be commented for clarity.  

Ask me if you have questions.
