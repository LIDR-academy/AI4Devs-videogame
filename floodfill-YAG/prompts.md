# Flood-Fill Game Development Prompts

## Understanding the Assignment

- Explain to me this codebase, specially understand the assignment from the @README.md

## Initial Setup and Requirements

- Create a small PRD, save the content in the file @PRD.md
- I want to create a puzzle game called: Food-Fill
- The target audience is indie gamers using a webbrowser
- This is both a Challenge and an educational research
- The app should be built using vanilla js, at least great part of this, keeping the best practices for a javascript product, it should be simple but still should include SOLID principles and OWASP best principles, it will be running on web browsers, mostly new browsers but with some compatibility for old browsers (not that old like IE7), the code should not be compiled.
- The basic features of a Flood-fill game (if you have suggestions you can ask me for confirmation), it should include a local scoreboard
- Let's not include deep time specifications on the PRD, it should be simple enough to understand the product and to share it with people interested
- The visual preferences should feel like 8-bit indie games, i can provide you further assets later
