Here's a step-by-step overview to create a Tetris MVP:

## 1. Game Design & Requirements
- **Game Designer**: Defines game mechanics, scoring, difficulty progression
- **Business Analyst**: Establishes MVP scope, target audience, success metrics

## 2. Architecture Design
- **Software Architect**: Creates technical architecture, component structure, data flow
- **Technical Lead**: Makes technology stack decisions, considering performance requirements

## 3. Core Game Engine
- **Game Engine Developer**: Implements tetromino physics, collision detection, rotation logic
- **Graphics Programmer**: Handles rendering, animation systems

## 4. UI/UX Design
- **UI/UX Designer**: Creates intuitive interface, visual feedback systems
- **Graphic Artist**: Designs tetromino blocks, backgrounds, visual assets

## 5. Implementation
- **Frontend Developer**: Builds responsive user interface, input handling
- **Backend Developer**: Implements scoring system, state management, persistence (if needed)

## 6. Testing
- **QA Engineer**: Verifies game mechanics, identifies bugs
- **UX Tester**: Evaluates playability, user satisfaction

## 7. Optimization
- **Performance Engineer**: Ensures smooth gameplay across target platforms
- **Mobile Developer**: Handles touch controls, device compatibility (if mobile)

## 8. Deployment
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up build pipeline, deployment process
- **System Administrator**: Manages hosting, monitoring (if online features planned)

## 9. Feedback & Iteration
- **Data Analyst**: Analyzes user metrics, gameplay patterns
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes improvements for next iteration
