# Tetris MVP - Architecture Design

## Technical Architecture

### Overall Architecture
The Tetris MVP will follow a component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns. We'll implement a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate game logic from presentation and input handling.

### Layers
1. **Core Game Engine** - Contains the game logic and state management
2. **Rendering Layer** - Handles the visual representation of the game
3. **Input Controller** - Processes user inputs and maps them to game actions
4. **Audio System** - Manages sound effects and background music
5. **UI Layer** - Displays game information, menus, and overlays

## Component Structure

### Game Core Components
- **GameManager**: Central controller managing game state and flow
- **Board**: Represents the game grid (10x20), tracks filled cells
- **TetrominoFactory**: Creates random tetromino pieces
- **Tetromino**: Base class for all tetromino shapes with rotation logic
- **CollisionSystem**: Handles collision detection between pieces and boundaries
- **ScoreManager**: Tracks points, lines cleared, and levels

### UI Components
- **Renderer**: Draws the game board, pieces, and UI elements
- **UIManager**: Handles menus, game over screen, pause overlay
- **InputHandler**: Processes keyboard/touch inputs
- **AudioController**: Manages sound effects and music playback
- **PreviewDisplay**: Shows the next piece
- **ScoreDisplay**: Shows current score, level, and lines cleared

## Data Flow

1. **Game Loop Flow**:
   - Input collection → Game state update → Collision detection → Line clearing → Scoring → Rendering

2. **Piece Movement Flow**:
   - User input → Validation (collision check) → Position update → Rendering

3. **Game State Flow**:
   - Piece placement → Line completion check → Score update → Level calculation → Speed adjustment

4. **Game Over Flow**:
   - Collision at spawn → Game over state → High score check → UI update

## Technology Stack

### Framework & Languages
- **Primary Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas for 2D rendering
- **Build System**: Webpack for bundling and optimization

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Canvas vs. DOM**: Using Canvas API for rendering instead of DOM elements for better performance with frequent updates
2. **RequestAnimationFrame**: For smooth 60fps animations and game loop
3. **State Management**: Simple state machine pattern without external libraries
4. **Asset Loading**: Pre-loading of audio and visual assets
5. **Mobile Support**: Touch controls with gesture recognition for mobile devices

### Performance Considerations
1. **Render Optimization**: Only redraw changed parts of the canvas
2. **Animation Frame Limiting**: Cap to 60fps to prevent excessive CPU usage
3. **Asset Size**: Minimize sprite sizes and audio files
4. **Memory Management**: Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
5. **Input Handling**: Debounce rapid input to prevent overwhelming game logic

### Scalability
1. **Module Pattern**: Encapsulated components for easy replacement/enhancement
2. **Extension Points**: Hooks for future multiplayer, more visual effects, or additional game modes
3. **Configuration Objects**: External config files for easy tuning of game parameters

## Technical Risks & Mitigations
1. **Input Latency**: Critical for tetris gameplay - implement prediction and input buffering
2. **Mobile Performance**: Optimize rendering cycle, reduce visual effects on lower-end devices
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Use polyfills and feature detection for wider support
4. **Touch Precision**: Implement intelligent touch zones and visual feedback

This architecture balances simplicity for the MVP with enough structure to allow for future extensions beyond the initial scope.
